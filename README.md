# Funny Wars

This project features a game developed in Python. FunnyWars is a 2D top-down multiplayer strategy game. As the name suggests, it's a humorous game where we control our main naked character, eat randomly appearing fruits on the map, and command poop soldiers (spawned by running) to fight others. The player who reaches the toilet wins the game.

FunnyWars was born out of a desire between my close friend Arda Akdoğan and me during our high school years to create a funny strategy game together.
Unfortunately, due to academic reasons, the game remained only a prototype and was never fully completed. However, it turned out to be a fun project that helped us improve our planning and collaboration skills.
